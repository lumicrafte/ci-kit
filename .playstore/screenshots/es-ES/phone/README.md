# Phone Screenshots (es-ES)

Place 2-8 phone screenshots here for the Spanish (Spain) locale.

## Localized Screenshots

These screenshots should show your app in Spanish:
- UI text in Spanish
- Sample content in Spanish
- Same requirements as en-US screenshots

## Requirements

- **Quantity**: Minimum 2, maximum 8 screenshots
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Dimensions**: Min 320px, max 3840px
- **File Size**: Keep under 8MB per screenshot

## Tips for Localized Screenshots

- Ensure all UI text is properly translated
- Use culturally appropriate sample content
- Consider regional differences (es-ES vs es-MX)
- Maintain visual consistency with other locales

Replace this README with actual Spanish screenshots if you have a localized app.
